                Branding is a set of marketing and communication methods that
                help to distinguish a company or products from competitors,
                aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of customers.
                The key components that form a brand&#39;s toolbox include a
                brand&rsquo;s identity, brand communication (such as by logos
                and trademarks), brand awareness, brand loyalty, and various
                branding (brand management) strategies. As markets become
                increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is a
                marketing technique to increase customer satisfaction and
                customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price
                sensitivity. A brand is in essence a promise to its customers of
                they can expect from their products, as well as emotional
                benefits. When a customer is familiar with a brand, or favors it
                incomparably to its competitors, this is when a corporation has
                reached a high level of brand equity. The earliest origins of
                branding can be traced to pre-historic times. Over time, the
                practice was extended to marking personal property such as
                pottery or tools, and eventually some type of brand or insignia
                was attached to goods intended for trade. A number of
                archaeological research studies have found extensive evidence of
                branding, packaging and labelling in antiquity. Archaeologists
                have identified some 1,000 different Roman potters&rsquo; marks
                the early Roman Empire, suggesting that branding was a
                relatively widespread practice.

              Branding is a set of marketing and communication methods that help
              to distinguish a company or products from competitors, aiming to
              create a lasting impression in the minds of customers. The key

              the early Roman Empire, suggesting that branding was a relatively
              widespread practice. Still to date, Every business wants to be a
              customer&#39;s first choice. Building and managing a brand can
              play a significant part in making that happen. Your brand is what
              you are really selling to your customers, not just a product or
              service for which there may already be many existing providers. A
              strong brand can make any business stand out from the crowd,
              particularly in competitive markets. Customers and employees can
              build up emotional attachments to certain brands, allowing for
              strong loyalties and even a sense of ownership. This can help
              maintain employee motivation and increase your sales. The concept
              of a brand extends far beyond just your company logo to your
              business&#39; core values and to every interaction you have with
              customers and suppliers. In effect, your brand creates and
              maintains your reputation and so reflects your customers&#39;
              experience of your organization. Building your brand If you want
              to build and maintain a strong brand, you&#39;ll need to focus on
              what your customers want and how you can guarantee to deliver it.
              You&#39;ll need to be consistent in your service and every other
              point of contact customers have with you - for example phone
              calls, letters, emails, etc. Once you&#39;ve defined your brand
              values and your customers&#39; needs you can start to build your
              brand by consistently communicating your brand values. Remember
              that every possible contact you have with a customer or potential
              customer needs to reinforce your brand values. Key areas to
              consider are: your business name the names of your products or
              services any slogan you use your logo the style and quality of
              your stationery product pricing and packaging your premises where
              and how you advertise how you and your employees dress how you and
              your employees behave your company website If all these are
              consistently in line with your brand values, your brand will be
              strengthened. But if all of them aren&#39;t in line, your brand -
              and your business - could be seriously damaged. A brand makes
              promises to customers and if they aren&#39;t fulfilled, your
              customers will be far less likely to buy again. Your logo can be
              of particular significance to customers. You should create a
              policy on its usage, ensuring it is used consistently and its
              quality is always maintained. This acts as a reassurance when
              customers are considering buying your products or receive them
              after purchase. Your logo can act as an initial guarantee of
              quality in these circumstances. Similarly, ensure that you
              consider the design and quality of your invoices and receipts,
              which can often be the last stage in an interaction with a
              customer. This can affect their willingness to give you repeat
              custom and even to pay on time. Managing your brand It&#39;s a
              good idea to get one person to take responsibility for your brand
              strategy - if you can&#39;t do it yourself, appoint a qualified
              marketing company instead. Get regular feedback from satisfied
              customers to check that your business is consistently delivering
              on the promises your brand makes. Ask dissatisfied customers or
              former customers as well - you can gain valuable, and sometimes
              more honest, information from them about how your brand is
              perceived. Honest and constructive criticism can help you see
              where there&#39;s room for improvement. Remember that customers
              change too. See the page in this guide on reviewing your brand for
              details of how regular reviews help you ensure that your brand
              still matches their needs and preferences. Even the most
              traditional and well-established brands have to work hard to stay
              relevant to their customers. Reviewing your brand A successful
              brand will remain so as long as you and your staff maintain its
              values in the eyes of your customers. If there are any problems
              with your customers&#39; experiences, don&#39;t be tempted to just
              change your logo (often mistakenly referred to as a
              &quot;rebrand&quot;) to solve them. This is an expensive process
              and would not solve the problems, if they are centered on failings
              in your systems or staff training, for example. Remember that your
              brand represents the whole customer experience, not just your
              signage or stationery, and cannot be changed overnight. You should
              regularly review your customers&#39; experiences of your business.
              This will provide an early indication of any elements of your
              brand that are underperforming. Prompt action to correct this
              underperforming element can save a lot of money and negate the
              need to rebrand your whole business. Growth opportunities To grow
              your business, you should encourage innovation and the development
              of your products and services. This will help you to stay ahead of
              your competitors and respond to the changing needs of your
              customers. However, your brand should always underpin your core
              values and provide customers with a consistent and reliable
              experience. Your brand may therefore become synonymous with
              innovation, but in itself may never change. Budgeting for a brand
              As your brand should encompass most areas of your business, from
              stationery to how you deliver your product or service to
              customers, it can be difficult to define a budget for building and
              maintaining it. The key areas you could budget for are: design
              needs, such as a logo, signage, business stationery or product
              packaging your premises your advertising keeping your company
              website updated You can create stationery, logos, packaging and
              advertising quite cheaply if the budget is tight. However, it is a
              good idea to think about your future growth when devising your
              image as changing it later can prove costly. You may also find
              that customers and employees will have already built up a
              relationship with your brand, which can then make it more
              problematic to change. Ten tips on branding To build a successful
              brand you should: Focus on what your business achieves for its
              customers. Your brand is no good to you if it isn&#39;t delivering
              what customers want. Take ownership of your brand. Pay attention
              to customers&#39; needs, but you should still control what you
              want your brand to mean to them. Be honest. If you don&#39;t
              believe in your brand, no one else will. Keep your brand simple by
              focusing on a small number of key brand values. Be consistent.
              Every aspect of your business should make customers feel the same
              way about you. Be thorough. Look at all your systems to make sure
              they help to support your brand. Involve employees. Make sure they
              understand your brand and believe in it. Communicate your brand.
              Make sure every advertisement, brochure and letter helps reinforce
              the same message. If you have a logo, use it everywhere, but make
              sure the quality is consistent. Meet and exceed what your brand
              promises. Failing, just once, will damage your brand. Manage your
              brand. Continually look for opportunities to make improvements.
              And don&#39;t be afraid to make changes to reflect shifts in the
              way you do business or new trends in your market.
